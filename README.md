# advanced-forms
# Starting this project to style Squiz advanced forms to make their look and feel identical to those of our Desitn system's: https://www.design-system.health.qld.gov.au/
# This project aims to produce a CDN file that can be used with advanced forms through Squiz DXP advance forms dashboard to implement the styles. 


# How to create work branch: 
# It is recommended for every working branch to have this format in its name: 
# [fix, feature or patch]:[A few words on what the branch is about]-[The ticket number that ordered the change]
# Every single commit should have this as it's comment: [A very brief exmplanation on what the change is]-[The ticket number that ordered the change]

# ########### NOTE AMIR:  This is the form: https://qhonline.com.au/qgds-development/sandbox/manjeet/advanced-form-styles/_nocache - not a big deal but remove this from this file when you can as  the future readers of the file might not have access to this specific file.
